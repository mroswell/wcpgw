content: <p>In Pennsylvania, if you're voting by mail, be careful to include the secrecy
  envelope and your outer (signed!) envelope... even if you are using a dropbox instead
  of the mail. Use the two envelopes or your ballot will be considered a "naked ballot"
  (and will not be counted!).</p><p></p>
